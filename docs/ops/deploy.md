# Deploying FlowBuddy to Render

One deploy guide for both live environments — **dev/staging** (free tier, `$0`) and **production**
(FlowBuddyAI.com, ~`$30`/mo) — over one code base and **two blueprint files**. The dev sections are
the free-tier walkthrough with every first-deploy gotcha; the production sections are the as-run
runbook for the live product. The **shared foundations** (§2) apply to every environment. For local
dev see [`dev-setup.md`](dev-setup.md); for what the modules are see [`copilot.md`](../build/copilot.md).

> **Status:** production **deployed 2026-07-17 · Version 1 launched + user-verified E2E on prod
> 2026-07-23**. §4 is the as-run production runbook; §3 tracks the dev/staging stack.

---

## 1. The three environments

| Environment | Where | Branch | Config | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Local dev** | your machine | any | `docker-compose` (Postgres + Redis + MinIO) + `pnpm dev` per package — [`dev-setup.md`](dev-setup.md) | day-to-day development |
| **Cloud dev / staging** | Render, free tier | `dev` | the `flowbuddy-dev-*` services (§3), created fresh 2026-07-17; free Postgres self-deletes every 30 days — treat as disposable | cloud E2E testing (recorder → prod-like URLs), demoing |
| **Production** | Render, paid | `main` | the `flowbuddy-*` services (§4), fronted by **FlowBuddyAI.com** custom domains | the live product |

`main` receives code only by explicit fast-forward from `dev`, so **every push to `main` is a
production deploy** (Render auto-deploys the connected branch).

---

## 2. Shared foundations (every environment)

### 2.1 Two blueprint files ride every branch

App code stays host-agnostic; Render reads a **blueprint file** per environment (custom blueprint
paths make this possible), so FF releases stay clean and each environment stays YAML-managed:

| File | Environment | Blueprint instance reads it from |
|---|---|---|
| [`render.yaml`](../../render.yaml) (repo root, default path) | **Production** — the §4 topology | branch `main` |
| [`render.dev.yaml`](../../render.dev.yaml) (custom path) | **Dev/staging** — the §3 free-tier config | branch `dev` |

**Standing ordering rule:** any change to *dev* infra goes in `render.dev.yaml`; any change to *prod*
infra goes in `render.yaml` and reaches Render only via the `main` FF. Never point a blueprint
instance at the other environment's file (applying `render.yaml` from `dev` would build the paid prod
stack).

### 2.2 Object storage (Cloudflare R2)

Screenshots / audio / DOM snapshots live in **Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible). Artifacts stay
**private**; the app serves them via presigned URLs. **Two separate buckets, never shared:**
`flowbuddy-artifacts-dev` (dev) and `flowbuddy-artifacts` (prod) — so a dev data reset can never
touch prod artifacts. Pre-create the bucket — the API runs `HeadBucket` at boot, so it never needs
bucket-create permission.

Since the direct-upload change the **recorder writes every artifact itself, via presigned PUT URLs**
(`POST /v1/uploads/sign`, 900s TTL) — screenshots and DOM snapshots *while* the capture runs, and the
**narration track at Stop** — so on a healthy connection the API never relays artifact bytes at all.
Three consequences for a deploy:
- **R2 accepts those PUTs directly from the extension — proven on the dev deploy 2026-07-28**, with
  **no bucket CORS rule added**. The recorder issues them from its service worker under `<all_urls>`
  host permissions, so there is nothing to configure on the bucket beyond what §3.3 already creates.
  *(This was the one part of the upload rework that could not be proven locally — MinIO is more
  permissive than R2 on both checksums and cross-origin PUTs.)*
- **The R2 token needs delete, not just write.** Cleanup of abandoned recordings removes the objects
  under a session prefix; the **Object Read & Write** token in §3.3 already covers it, but a
  read-only or write-only token would leave storage growing silently. That cleanup rides
  fire-and-forget on the next finalize **by design, so there is no cron service in either blueprint**
  to pay for or to monitor — which is why nothing scheduled appears in the YAML. Route semantics, the
  sweep and why its threshold is what it is:
  [`internals/ingestion-api.md`](../internals/ingestion-api.md) §4.6.
- **The presigner runs with `requestChecksumCalculation: 'WHEN_REQUIRED'`**
  ([`packages/api/src/storage.ts`](../../packages/api/src/storage.ts)). With the SDK default the signer
  bakes an empty-body CRC32 into the signed URL; **MinIO ignores it and R2 rejects it** — i.e. the
  failure passes local dev and appears only in the cloud. Never "simplify" that back onto the shared
  client.

### 2.3 The worker is folded into the API (both environments)

The synthesis worker runs *inside* the api web service via the `start:all` entrypoint
([`packages/api/src/all.ts`](../../packages/api/src/all.ts) imports both the server and the worker into
one process). In **dev** this is forced by Render (background workers are paid-only); in **prod** it's
a deliberate choice — synthesis is almost entirely I/O-bound (Whisper/GPT-4o/embedding network calls),
so it barely contends with answer traffic. Trade-off: a deploy restart kills an in-flight synthesis
job (`attempts=1`, no auto-retry — fix is re-recording). Migrations run in the same start command
(`prisma migrate deploy` before boot).

**What sharing one instance costs, and how it's paid for (2026-07-28).** The api and the worker share
one 512 MB container, and the api half serves *customers' end-users* — so an out-of-memory kill in the
worker takes the public copilot down with it. Two guards, both in the blueprints:
- **Worker concurrency is `1`, not `2`** ([`worker.ts`](../../packages/api/src/worker.ts)) — a synthesis
  job holds whole screenshots in memory for the vision calls, so two at once is the realistic OOM
  path. Throughput isn't the constraint: recordings arrive one at a time, from a human pressing Stop.
- **`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=400`** on the api service — caps the V8 heap *below* the
  container limit so the process collects garbage instead of being OOM-killed mid-request.

**Splitting the worker into its own Render service is SKIPPED (decision 2026-07-28).** It costs ~$7/mo,
and most of its rationale evaporated once the api stopped relaying artifact bytes (§2.2): the api's
memory and time per recording are now a manifest, not hundreds of megabytes. It stays on the scaling
ladder as **Step 1** (§9) for when the trigger actually appears.

### 2.4 The service-URL suffix gotcha

**Render appends a random suffix to a service's hostname if the plain name is already taken** — e.g.
you may get `https://flowbuddy-dev-web-x4k2.onrender.com` even though the service is named
`flowbuddy-dev-web` (the first-ever deploy got `-uir8`; the 2026-07-17 rebuild got all plain names —
don't count on either). There is **no blueprint reference for a service's public URL**, so after the
services appear, open each in the dashboard and copy its **real** URL into the env vars that need it
(§3.8 / §4). In **prod** every URL secret is a custom domain, so this only matters for the DNS CNAME
targets, never for env vars or embed snippets.

### 2.5 Logging in production

The Node services log **structured JSON at `info`+** in prod (`NODE_ENV=production` is set in the
Dockerfiles; each line carries its `service` and secrets are redacted). Both blueprints set
`LOG_LEVEL: info` explicitly on the api + web services so the level is visible and tunable in the
dashboard.

**Change the level without a code redeploy** — Render → the service → **Environment** → edit
`LOG_LEVEL` → save. Render restarts the service with the new value:

| Set `LOG_LEVEL` to | To… |
|---|---|
| `debug` | trace a request/synthesis path in prod (verbose — **set back to `info`** after) |
| `warn` | quieten a chatty service to warnings + errors only |
| `silent` | mute a service entirely |

`LOG_PRETTY=1` would switch a service to human-readable lines (rarely wanted in prod — JSON is what
log search ingests). The **Studio browser console** level is separate and **build-time**
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL`, default `warn` in prod) — changing it means a rebuild, not just an env edit.
Full model + local usage: [`dev-setup.md` §7](dev-setup.md#7-logging-dev-vs-prod-and-how-to-turn-it-updown).

### 2.6 Health checks (added 2026-07-28)

Both blueprints declare a `healthCheckPath` on their **api** service; the prod blueprint adds one for Studio too. (Dev's Studio has none — it is a free-tier service that cold-starts anyway, so a liveness probe buys little there.) **Without one, Render only checks
that the port is open** — which a wedged, deadlocked or CPU-pinned process passes trivially, so a
service in exactly the state you'd want restarted would never be restarted. The same check also gates
zero-downtime deploys: traffic only moves to the new instance once the path answers.

| Service | Path | Why that path |
|---|---|---|
| `flowbuddy-api` / `flowbuddy-dev-api` | `/healthz` | the existing health route in [`server.ts`](../../packages/api/src/server.ts) — answers `{"ok":true}` |
| `flowbuddy-web` (prod only) | `/signin` | Studio has no dedicated health endpoint; `/signin` needs the Next server to actually be rendering. Note it is a **sign-in page**, not an unauthenticated endpoint — it answers for a logged-out visitor, which is all the probe needs. It must be a **real route** — `/` only redirects, and a path that 404s fails the probe forever (see Troubleshooting) |

Static sites (`flowbuddy-widget`, `flowbuddy-landing`) have no health check — there is no process.
Note the check is a **liveness** signal only: `/healthz` doesn't touch Postgres or Redis, so a
database outage does not (and should not) trigger a restart loop.

---

## 3. Dev / staging deploy (Render free tier, $0)

### 3.1 What gets deployed (topology)

The `render.dev.yaml` blueprint provisions **5 resources** (all free):

| Resource | Type | Runtime | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flowbuddy-dev-db` | PostgreSQL | Postgres 18 | the database |
| `flowbuddy-dev-redis` | Key Value | Valkey 8 | BullMQ job queue (synthesis) |
| `flowbuddy-dev-api` | Web service | Docker | copilot answer API + recorder ingestion **+ the synthesis worker** (folded in — §2.3) |
| `flowbuddy-dev-web` | Web service | Docker | the Next.js **Studio** (approve workflows, copilot settings, analytics) |
| `flowbuddy-dev-widget` | Static site | Static | hosts the embeddable `flowbuddy-copilot.js` bundle **+ its sibling `flowbuddy-copilot-render.js`** (the lazy P2-M5 image-tier renderer — always publish BOTH from the same `packages/widget/dist/` build; the widget derives the renderer URL as a sibling of its own `src`, and a missing file degrades diagnostics to structure-only, silently) |

Plus an **environment group** `flowbuddy-dev-r2` holding the shared Cloudflare R2 credentials.

### 3.2 Prerequisites

- A **Render** account.
- A **Cloudflare** account with **R2** enabled.
- An **OpenAI API key** (`sk-…`) with billing/credit — transcription + synthesis. Model ids: [`.env.example`](../../.env.example).
- The repo on **GitHub** (Render deploys from GitHub) and permission to authorize Render to read it.

### 3.3 Cloudflare R2 setup

1. Cloudflare → **R2** → **Create bucket** → name it exactly `flowbuddy-artifacts-dev`
   (`flowbuddy-artifacts` without the suffix is the **production** bucket — §2.2). Pre-create it.
2. R2 → **Manage R2 API Tokens** → **Create API token** → permission **Object Read & Write**, scoped to that bucket (an account-wide Object R/W token works too).
3. Note three values: **Access Key ID**, **Secret Access Key**, **S3 endpoint** (`https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` — account ID is on the R2 overview page).

### 3.4 Generate the auth secret

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
Keep the output for `AUTH_SECRET` (Studio / Auth.js).

### 3.5 Push the code to the deploy branch

Render reads the blueprint file from the branch you connect. Make sure the final code **and** the
blueprint file (`render.dev.yaml`) are committed and pushed to `dev` before creating the blueprint.

### 3.6 Create the Blueprint on Render

1. Render dashboard → **New +** → **Blueprint**.
2. Connect/authorize the GitHub repo → select branch **`dev`**.
3. Set the **blueprint file path** to `render.dev.yaml` (the default `render.yaml` is the PROD spec).
4. Render parses the file and shows the 5 resources + the `flowbuddy-dev-r2` group. Click **Apply**.
   ⚠️ Render does **not** prompt for env-**group** values here — fill the `flowbuddy-dev-r2` group in
   the dashboard right after Apply (the api's first boot fails harmlessly without it, then recovers
   on the save-triggered redeploy).

### 3.7 Set the secrets

Render prompts for every `sync: false` value. Set them as below. **URLs are not guaranteed** — see
the [suffix gotcha](#24-the-service-url-suffix-gotcha) — set your best guess now and correct in §3.8.

| Variable | Where | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `R2_ENDPOINT` | `flowbuddy-dev-r2` group | `https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `flowbuddy-dev-r2` group | R2 token access key |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `flowbuddy-dev-r2` group | R2 token secret |
| `R2_BUCKET` | `flowbuddy-dev-r2` group | `flowbuddy-artifacts-dev` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `flowbuddy-dev-api` **and** `flowbuddy-dev-web` | your `sk-…` (api: synthesis + the copilot answer engine; web's one use: re-indexing founder-edited step text at save — the tester still answers via the api) |
| `EMBED_MODEL` | `flowbuddy-dev-api` + `flowbuddy-dev-web` (blueprint sets both) | `text-embedding-3-small` — P1-M3 hybrid retrieval; must resolve identically on every service. ⚠️ Must be a **1536-dim** model (the `vector(1536)` column); the migration runs `CREATE EXTENSION vector` on deploy. |
| `FLOWBUDDY_STUDIO_URL` | **`flowbuddy-dev-api`** | the real `flowbuddy-dev-web` URL (§3.8) — the Studio origin is exempt from workspace origin allowlists so the Copilot page's real-widget tester keeps working after a customer restricts origins. ⚠️ Unset = the tester 403s for allowlisted workspaces. |
| `REASON_MODEL` | `flowbuddy-dev-api` (optional) | the P2-M5 diagnostic path's model (must be vision-capable); unset = falls back to `SYNTH_MODEL` |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | `flowbuddy-dev-web` | output of §3.4 |
| `AUTH_URL` | `flowbuddy-dev-web` | the real `flowbuddy-dev-web` URL (§3.8) |
| `FLOWBUDDY_API_URL` | `flowbuddy-dev-web` | the real `flowbuddy-dev-api` URL (§3.8) |
| `FLOWBUDDY_WIDGET_URL` | `flowbuddy-dev-web` | the real `flowbuddy-dev-widget` URL + `/flowbuddy-copilot.js` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `flowbuddy-dev-web` | Resend key — **enables** email verification + password reset. ⚠️ Before first enable, backfill: `UPDATE "User" SET "emailVerified" = now() WHERE "passwordHash" IS NOT NULL AND "emailVerified" IS NULL;` — pre-existing accounts can't sign in otherwise. Optional `EMAIL_FROM` overrides the sender (default `noreply@flowbuddyai.com`; the domain must be verified in Resend). |

Auto-wired by the blueprint (do **not** set): `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `PORT`, `R2_REGION`,
`TRANSCRIBE_MODEL`, `SYNTH_MODEL`, `AUTH_TRUST_HOST`, `LOG_LEVEL` (`info` — tunable live, §2.5),
`NODE_OPTIONS` (the heap cap for the shared api+worker instance, §2.3).

> **All three of `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, and the R2 group are mandatory for a working stack** —
> and each fails at a *different* moment (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-real-errors-we-hit)).

### 3.8 Fix the service URLs

Per the [suffix gotcha](#24-the-service-url-suffix-gotcha):

1. After the services appear, open **each** of `flowbuddy-dev-api`, `flowbuddy-dev-web`, `flowbuddy-dev-widget` and copy its **real** URL.
2. On `flowbuddy-dev-web`, set the URL secrets to the **real** values:
   - `AUTH_URL` = real `flowbuddy-dev-web` URL
   - `FLOWBUDDY_API_URL` = real `flowbuddy-dev-api` URL (baked into the browser embed snippet **and** the extension connect payload — must be the public URL, never internal)
   - `FLOWBUDDY_WIDGET_URL` = real `flowbuddy-dev-widget` URL + `/flowbuddy-copilot.js`
3. Also set `FLOWBUDDY_STUDIO_URL` on `flowbuddy-dev-api` = the real `flowbuddy-dev-web` URL.
4. **Redeploy `flowbuddy-dev-web`** so the embed snippet and auth callbacks use the corrected URLs.

### 3.9 First deploy — what happens

- Each Docker image builds (full `pnpm install` per image — a few minutes). ⚠️ **The Docker build has NO Render env vars** — a Studio page Next can statically prerender bakes env-derived values (feature flags, keys) into HTML as `undefined`, and local dev won't catch it because env exists at build there. A page whose output depends on runtime env must render per-request (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` — how `/signup` keeps its Google button).
- `flowbuddy-dev-api` start command runs `prisma migrate deploy` (creates all tables) **then** boots Fastify + the embedded worker. Success in the logs:
  ```
  All migrations have been successfully applied.
  {"level":"info","service":"api","port":8787,"env":"production","msg":"FlowBuddy api listening"}
  {"level":"info","service":"worker","queue":"synthesis","msg":"listening on queue"}
  ```
- A `503` on the first hit to `flowbuddy-dev-web` / `flowbuddy-dev-api` is a **free-tier cold start** (~1 min), **not** a crash.

### 3.10 Smoke test

- `flowbuddy-dev-widget` URL + `/flowbuddy-copilot.js` serves a minified JS bundle (global static site — no cold start).
- `flowbuddy-dev-widget` URL + `/flowbuddy-copilot-render.js` serves the P2-M5 renderer bundle too (the widget lazy-loads it as a sibling of its own `src` when "Include page image" is on).
- `flowbuddy-dev-web` URL renders the **FlowBuddy Studio** sign-in page.
- Create an account in Studio (this exercises `AUTH_SECRET` + the DB).

Then connect the extension (§5) and run the end-to-end test (§6).

### 3.11 Free-tier caveats (dev only)

- **Free Postgres is deleted 30 days after creation** (14-day grace) — recreate when it lapses.
- **Free Key Value has no persistence** — a restart drops queued synthesis jobs (low risk: jobs run right after upload).
- **Free web services spin down after ~15 min idle** (~1 min cold start). The embedded worker only runs while `flowbuddy-dev-api` is awake.
- **750 free instance-hours/month per workspace** (shared); spun-down services don't consume them.

## 4. Production deploy (FlowBuddyAI.com, ~$30/mo)

### 4.1 Topology + cost (locked 2026-07-16)

**~$30/month.** Seven resources, distinct `flowbuddy-*` names (so they coexist with the dev
`flowbuddy-dev-*` services in the same Render workspace):

| Resource | Type | Plan | Custom domain | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `flowbuddy-landing` | Static site | **Free** | `flowbuddyai.com` + `www` | marketing landing page (`packages/landing`) |
| `flowbuddy-web` | Web (Docker) | **Starter $7** | `app.flowbuddyai.com` | the Studio (Next.js) |
| `flowbuddy-api` | Web (Docker) | **Starter $7** | `api.flowbuddyai.com` | copilot answer API + ingestion **+ the embedded synthesis worker** (`start:all`) |
| `flowbuddy-widget` | Static site | **Free** | `widget.flowbuddyai.com` | serves `flowbuddy-copilot.js` + `flowbuddy-copilot-render.js` (both, always, from one build) |
| `flowbuddy-db` | PostgreSQL | **Basic-256mb $6** (+$0.30/GB extra) | — | the database (durable — no 30-day deletion) |
| `flowbuddy-redis` | Key Value | **Starter $10** | — | BullMQ synthesis queue (persistent) |
| `flowbuddy-r2` | Env group | — | — | shared Cloudflare R2 credentials (prod bucket) |

**Decisions recorded (and their trade-offs):**
- **Worker folded into the API** (`start:all`) — see §2.3, including the heap cap + concurrency-1 guards that make one 512 MB instance safe to share. **Splitting it out was reconsidered and skipped 2026-07-28** (~$7/mo, and the api no longer carries artifact bytes); it remains Scale step 1 (§9).
- **Key Value is paid (Starter $10) — revised 2026-07-17 at first deploy.** The original "stays free" plan hit a platform limit: Render allows only **one free Key Value instance per workspace**, and dev holds it (`flowbuddy-dev-redis`). Paying also buys **persistence** — the "a restart drops a queued job" caveat is gone in prod (Scale step 2's first option, arrived early). `maxmemoryPolicy: noeviction` stays set.
- **Studio is paid (Starter)** — customers work here; a ~1-min free-tier cold start reads as "broken product".
- **The API is paid and always-on, non-negotiable** — it serves customers' end-users on every widget question; a cold start there is a broken copilot on someone else's site.
- **Postgres is paid, non-negotiable** — the free plan self-deletes after 30 days; prod data must be durable, and paid plans get point-in-time recovery.
- **Migrations stay in the start command** — additive, and on paid plans Render health-checks the new instance before switching traffic, so the old one keeps serving while the new one migrates. Moving to a `preDeployCommand` happens at Scale step 1 with the worker split.

### 4.2 Domains & DNS

Registrar: **GoDaddy**, DNS hosted there too (as-built 2026-07-17 — the original plan said Cloudflare,
but only R2 lives on Cloudflare; GoDaddy has no proxy layer, so Render provisions and renews TLS
itself). ⚠️ First-deploy gotcha (hit live): **delete the registrar's default parking A records on the
apex** (e.g. `13.248.243.5` / `76.223.105.230`) — with stray A records present, DNS round-robins to
parking servers AND Render won't verify the apex or issue its certificate. GoDaddy doesn't flatten
CNAMEs at the apex — use the A record.

| Record | Type | Points to |
|---|---|---|
| `flowbuddyai.com` | A record (no apex CNAME flattening) | the apex IP Render shows when you add the domain to `flowbuddy-landing` (currently `216.24.57.1`) |
| `www.flowbuddyai.com` | CNAME | `flowbuddy-landing`'s `*.onrender.com` hostname |
| `app.flowbuddyai.com` | CNAME | `flowbuddy-web`'s `*.onrender.com` hostname |
| `api.flowbuddyai.com` | CNAME | `flowbuddy-api`'s `*.onrender.com` hostname |
| `widget.flowbuddyai.com` | CNAME | `flowbuddy-widget`'s `*.onrender.com` hostname |

Render auto-redirects `www` ↔ apex once both are added to the landing site. The `*.onrender.com`
hostnames may carry the [suffix](#24-the-service-url-suffix-gotcha) — copy the real ones from the dashboard.

**Why custom domains are set up BEFORE onboarding anyone:** the Studio-generated embed snippet bakes
`FLOWBUDDY_API_URL` + `FLOWBUDDY_WIDGET_URL` into every customer's `<script>` tag. Whatever URL is live
when a customer embeds is a URL you serve forever. With all env URLs on the custom domains from day
one, `onrender.com` never leaks into a snippet — and the underlying Render service can be swapped
later without breaking a single embed.

### 4.3 The production blueprint (`render.yaml`) — written 2026-07-17

The root [`render.yaml`](../../render.yaml) is authoritative for the prod spec — plans, env wiring, and
per-service notes live there as comments (see the two-blueprint model, §2.1). Highlights: paid
api/web/db per §4.1, `maxmemoryPolicy: noeviction` on the queue, migrations in the api start command,
a `healthCheckPath` on each web service (§2.6), `NODE_OPTIONS` capping the api's heap (§2.3),
and the two static sites (widget bundles + the `packages/landing` page) built with
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter <pkg> build`.

**Prod secrets (all `sync: false`):**

| Variable | Service | Prod value |
|---|---|---|
| `R2_*` | `flowbuddy-r2` group | the **prod** bucket `flowbuddy-artifacts` + its own Object R/W token — never share the dev bucket |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `flowbuddy-api` **and** `flowbuddy-web` | your `sk-…` (web's one use: re-indexing founder-edited step text at save — end-user answers still all go through the api) |
| `FLOWBUDDY_STUDIO_URL` | `flowbuddy-api` | `https://app.flowbuddyai.com` (Studio origin allowlist-exemption for the real-widget tester) |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | `flowbuddy-web` | fresh `openssl rand -hex 32` — do NOT reuse dev's |
| `AUTH_URL` | `flowbuddy-web` | `https://app.flowbuddyai.com` |
| `FLOWBUDDY_API_URL` | `flowbuddy-web` | `https://api.flowbuddyai.com` |
| `FLOWBUDDY_WIDGET_URL` | `flowbuddy-web` | `https://widget.flowbuddyai.com/flowbuddy-copilot.js` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `flowbuddy-web` | **required in prod** — no key = email disabled and signups auto-verify, so real users would never get verification/reset emails |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | `flowbuddy-web` | optional — the code default is `FlowBuddy <noreply@flowbuddyai.com>`; `flowbuddyai.com` must be verified in Resend |
| `FLOWBUDDY_EXTENSION_URL` | `flowbuddy-web` | the Chrome Web Store listing URL |

Because every URL secret is a custom domain, the suffix gotcha only matters for DNS CNAME targets —
never for env vars or snippets.

### 4.4 First-deploy runbook

The production stack was first deployed 2026-07-17 and the step-by-step as-run log is spent — the
repeatable parts are already the rules above: §2.1 (the blueprint-file ordering rule, the one that
bites), §4.2 (domains & DNS), §4.3 (the prod blueprint). `git log --follow docs/ops/deploy.md` has the original
account. What survives from it as standing gotchas is in **Troubleshooting** below.

---

## 5. Connect the recorder extension (build mechanics — every environment)

The Chrome extension is **not** deployed to Render — you build it locally pointed at the Studio(s) you
want it to connect to. A single env var (`STUDIO_URL`) bakes both the popup links (`__STUDIO_URL__`)
and the connect-bridge content-script `matches` (in [`packages/extension/build.mjs`](../../packages/extension/build.mjs)).
**It accepts a comma-separated list** — the FIRST entry is the primary (what the popup opens); ALL
entries get the connect bridge, so one artifact connects against several origins:

```bash
# dev + local
STUDIO_URL="https://<your-flowbuddy-dev-web-url>,http://localhost:3000" pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/extension build
```

Then `chrome://extensions` → **Load unpacked** → `packages/extension/dist` (or **Reload**). Click
**Connect** — it opens `<studio-url>/connect`, relays the token + API URL into the extension, and shows
as connected. *(Plain `pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/extension build` with no `STUDIO_URL` reverts to
localhost — the committed `src/manifest.json` stays localhost so local dev is unaffected.)*

**Chrome Web Store** (full per-version history + the cut-a-release checklist:
[`extension-releases.md`](extension-releases.md)). **v0.7.0 is cut with the upload rework and is the
build the current API requires** — it sends `X-FlowBuddy-Upload-Id`, uploads narration directly, and
discards abandoned recordings. §7.6 says it must be live *before* that API reaches prod; **on 2026-07-28 that ordering was deliberately overridden** (no customers on prod), so the API went out first and for a short window a store-installed v0.6.0 could not upload at all. The override is the reason §7.6 exists, and it only survived because nobody was using the product. v0.7.0 bakes the same
three origins as its predecessor and adds **no new permissions**: `https://app.flowbuddyai.com`
(primary) + `https://flowbuddy-dev-web.onrender.com` + localhost, FlowBuddy "F" icons. Listing (extension ID `njkfcfpehcklldmeofolnpdljdhcgofk`, stable across the rename; the
URL below carries the pre-rename slug — Chrome resolves by ID, so it keeps working):
<https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sync-recorder/njkfcfpehcklldmeofolnpdljdhcgofk>. Its listing
URL goes in `FLOWBUDDY_EXTENSION_URL` on **both** `flowbuddy-web` (prod) and `flowbuddy-dev-web` so the
Home checklist's install CTA reads "Add to Chrome". *(Per-version history: [`extension-releases.md`](extension-releases.md).)* The store zip is built from `dist/` (`cd dist && zip -r ../flowbuddy-recorder-<version>.zip .`).
⚠️ The baked Studio URL is part of the store artifact — moving to a new domain later means a rebuild +
resubmission (add the new domain to the list; keep the old one during the transition). ⚠️ After
zipping, re-run a plain build so your local `dist/` goes back to the localhost-primary dev build.

## 6. End-to-end test

Proving a fresh deploy is the same flow in every environment: **record** a narrated workflow →
**approve** it in Studio → embed the snippet on a page **served over HTTP** (never `file://`) → a
covered question answers with citations, an uncovered one declines honestly.

The steps, the log lines to watch and the per-environment gotchas belong to
[`e2e-testing.md`](e2e-testing.md), which owns how to test anything — **Level 1** local, **Level 2**
this dev deploy, **Level 3** production. Run the level that matches what you just deployed.

---

## 7. Ongoing releases

1. Work lands on `dev`; the dev cloud env auto-deploys it for cloud E2E.
2. On an explicit go: FF-sync `main` → Render auto-deploys the prod services.
3. Migrations run automatically on the api boot. Additive columns and **widening** changes (e.g. dropping a NOT NULL) are safe to roll forward; a new UNIQUE index is safe only while the column is nullable and unpopulated (which is how `20260727230000_upload_identity` ships). A **column-default flip** is safe *and* completely reversible, and for the same reason: there is no back-fill, so nothing was overwritten — flipping the default back is a full revert, and every existing row keeps whatever it already had, because a column default only ever applies to rows created afterwards. Anything narrowing still needs a plan.
   **⚠️ The build must run `prisma generate`** — Render's does, via `pnpm build`. The client bakes scalar defaults in at generate time and sends them explicitly, so **the client, not the column, is what a create applies**: a deploy that migrates without regenerating keeps handing new rows the *old* defaults while the database claims otherwise. The failure is silent and reads as "the migration didn't take". Why, in full: [`schema.prisma`](../../packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma).
4. Both widget bundles republish automatically (they're one static build).
5. The landing page redeploys only when `packages/landing` changes.
6. Extension releases run on the store review cycle — and they are **no longer independent of the API**. **Standing ordering rule (since the upload-identity change): a recorder build that a new API requires must be LIVE ON THE STORE BEFORE that API reaches prod.** `/v1/sessions` rejects any upload without the `X-FlowBuddy-Upload-Id` header, and store build **v0.6.0 does not send it** — deploying the API first breaks recording for every installed user. **v0.7.0 is the build that satisfies this** (cut with the upload rework; it sends the header, uploads narration directly, and calls the discard route). Check its live status in [`extension-releases.md`](extension-releases.md) before the FF to `main`.
7. **After a deploy, run the part of [`e2e-testing.md`](e2e-testing.md) that covers what changed.** It is organised by leg — recording, approval, the widget answer, positional/diagnostic/walkthrough, the acting run — so a targeted drop needs one leg, not the whole matrix; a change to ingestion or the answer path needs the whole flow.
8. **If the copilot misbehaves in production, every lever is per workspace and needs no deploy** — turn the on-page abilities off, turn diagnostics off, put the workspace back to Copilot, turn acting off for the one workflow, or un-approve it (the sharpest instrument: it stops being answerable at all). The full list, including the one lever that no longer exists: [running and shipping it](../plain-english/07-running-and-shipping-it.md#if-something-goes-wrong-with-the-assistant-in-production), in plain English.
9. **If recording uploads misbehave, there is no runtime toggle** — but the recorder degrades to the all-in-one bundle by itself whenever signing fails, so **disabling `/v1/uploads/sign` is a usable stopgap**. It does nothing for an *older* recorder: the identity-header requirement on `/v1/sessions` stands either way, so rolling the API back is the only way to serve one (item 6).

---

## 8. Upgrading an existing deploy

There is no separate upgrade procedure. An upgrade **is** §7 — push, migrations run on boot, both
widget bundles republish, and you run the leg of the test guide that covers what changed. Everything
an upgrade has ever needed to know that is still true next time has been folded into the standing
rules: migration safety and `prisma generate` in §7 item 3, the store-before-API ordering in item 6,
the rollback levers in items 8–9, the R2 delete permission in §2.2, and the health-check / heap-cap /
concurrency guards in §2.6 and §2.3.

**Per-drop history — which migrations shipped with which change, and in what order — is in
`git log`.** It is not maintained here.

<!-- §8 keeps its number deliberately: §9 is cited as "§9" from e2e-testing.md, and renumbering
     would leave that link valid while making it point at the wrong thing. -->

## 9. The scaling ladder (future prod)

Each step is a dashboard/plan change plus a small `render.yaml` edit — no re-architecture, and the
custom domains make every underlying swap invisible to customers.

**Step 1 — split the worker out (~$27/mo). ⏸ Considered and skipped 2026-07-28** — see §2.3: it costs ~$7/mo, and the rationale largely evaporated once the api stopped relaying artifact bytes; the heap cap + concurrency-1 make the shared instance safe enough for now. Still the right move at the trigger below. *Trigger:* synthesis jobs dying on deploys, answer latency dipping while jobs run, or repeated OOM restarts on the api.
- New `type: worker` service `flowbuddy-worker`, `dockerCommand: pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/api worker`, Starter plan.
- `flowbuddy-api` `dockerCommand` → plain `pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/api start`.
- Move migrations to `preDeployCommand: pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/db exec prisma migrate deploy` (paid plans support it). *(The standalone-worker blueprint shape is in git history — commit `3488326`.)*

**Step 2 — durable queue. ✅ Arrived early (2026-07-17):** prod Key Value is already paid/persistent (the one-free-instance limit forced it — §4.1). The remaining lever is **cost reduction**: swap BullMQ for a Postgres-backed queue (pg-boss) and delete Redis (−$10/mo; touches `packages/api/src/queue.ts`, `worker.ts`, `packages/web/lib/queue.ts`).

**Step 3 — headroom.** *Trigger:* sustained load, in rough order:
- Instance bumps: `starter` → `standard` on api/web; Postgres → a larger plan.
- **ANN index on the pgvector column** (deferred at P1-M3) once exact scans show up in answer latency.
- Horizontal scale on `flowbuddy-api` (stateless) — requires the Step-1 worker split first so N api instances don't each embed a worker.

**Step 4 — ops hardening (any time, cheap):**
- Uptime monitoring on `api.flowbuddyai.com` + `app.flowbuddyai.com` (also keeps first-byte warm).
- ~~Render health-check paths~~ — **done 2026-07-28** (§2.6). Still to do: alerting on failed deploys.
- Log level stays `info` (JSON), tunable live via `LOG_LEVEL` (§2.5).
- Postgres paid plans include point-in-time recovery; verify the recovery window fits.

## Troubleshooting (real errors we hit)

| Symptom in the logs | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Blueprint: `basic_256mb not a valid plan` | Render plan ids use **hyphens** | `basic-256mb` (Postgres). Service plans: `starter`, `standard`, … |
| Static build: `EROFS: read-only file system, unlink '/usr/bin/pnpx'` | `corepack enable` in Render's static builder (read-only `/usr/bin`) | Drop `corepack enable`; the builder already provides pnpm. Just `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/widget build` |
| `sh: 1: <whole command>: not found` · `Exited with status 127` | A `dockerCommand: sh -c "… && …"` — Render already wraps in its own `sh -c` | Make `dockerCommand` a **single token** (`pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/api start:all`) and put the `&&` chain **inside the npm script** |
| `AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED] … 127.0.0.1:9000` | `R2_ENDPOINT` unset → API defaults to local MinIO; `ensureBucket()` runs at **boot** | Set the R2 group (endpoint/keys/bucket) and redeploy the api |
| `[auth][error] MissingSecret: Please define a 'secret'` | `AUTH_SECRET` unset (pages still render — GET-only) | Set `AUTH_SECRET` on the web service; also set `AUTH_URL` to the real URL. ⚠️ Secrets typed during a **failed** blueprint sync die with it — re-enter after a clean apply |
| `[worker] failed …: 401 You didn't provide an API key` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset on the api | Set it on the api; **re-record** (failed jobs don't auto-retry — `attempts=1`) |
| `400 missing or malformed X-FlowBuddy-Upload-Id` on `/v1/sessions` | A recorder older than the upload-identity change (incl. store v0.6.0) uploading to a new API — the deploy-ordering rule in §7.6 was violated | Ship the newer recorder first, or roll the API back; a local rebuild fixes it for developers only |
| Presigned artifact `PUT` rejected by R2 (`400`/`403`) while it worked on MinIO | The signer emitted checksum params (the SDK default bakes an empty-body CRC32 into the URL) — R2 enforces them, MinIO ignores them | Keep the dedicated presigning client at `requestChecksumCalculation: 'WHEN_REQUIRED'` (§2.2); this class of bug is invisible locally |
| `could not enqueue synthesis — recording is stored; re-process from Studio` | Redis unreachable or slow at the moment the recording finalized; the enqueue is a bounded 5s race by design ([`internals/ingestion-api.md`](../internals/ingestion-api.md) §4.5) so the upload still succeeded | Fix/restart the Key Value instance, then Studio → the recording → **Re-process**. The recording itself is safe — do **not** ask the user to re-record |
| Recordings pile up with a **Recording** badge and never process | Captures that were started and abandoned. Expected on a testing environment; they are swept after 12h idle on the next finalize ([`internals/ingestion-api.md`](../internals/ingestion-api.md) §4.6) | Nothing to do — or force it by finishing any recording in that workspace. Deleting the row by hand also works |
| Copilot page real-widget tester returns nothing / errors | Since **Approach B** (2026-07-08) the tester embeds the real widget → it answers via the **api** `/v1/copilot/answer`. Cause is on the api: `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset, **or** a `403` because `FLOWBUDDY_STUDIO_URL` isn't set | Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` **and** `FLOWBUDDY_STUDIO_URL` (= the real Studio URL) on the api — the web service's own OpenAI key only affects saving step edits, never answers |
| `503` on first request | Free web service **cold start** (~1 min after 15 min idle) | Wait ~1 min; it's not a crash (dev only — prod is always-on) |
| Widget launcher doesn't appear | Page served via `file://`, or origin not in the allowlist (403) | Serve over HTTP; add the origin or empty the allowlist |
| `Eviction policy is allkeys-lru … should be "noeviction"` | Free Key Value default eviction (BullMQ prefers `noeviction`) | The blueprints set `maxmemoryPolicy: noeviction`; on an instance created before that, flip it in the dashboard (Key Value → Settings → Maxmemory Policy) |
| Apex domain won't verify / cert won't issue | Registrar parking **A records** on the apex (§4.2) | Delete the parking A records; keep only the Render apex IP |
| A service builds and boots clean — `✓ Ready in …ms` — but the log **never reaches `==> Your service is live`**, and the deploy hangs or rolls back | `healthCheckPath` points at a route that **404s**. Render needs 2xx/3xx there, so a perfectly healthy process is never routed to and gets restart-looped. Hit live on prod Studio 2026-07-31: the path was `/login`, but the Studio's sign-in route is `/signin` | Point it at a route that exists (§2.6). Dashboard → the service → Settings → Health Check Path unblocks it **immediately**; also fix the blueprint or the next sync reverts it. ⚠️ The boot log looks perfect — read it for the **absent** live line, not for an error |

## The FlowBuddy rename cutover (done 2026-07-17)

The product was renamed Sync → FlowBuddy and the dev environment was rebuilt from scratch the same
day. The cutover is complete and nothing pre-rename is still running, so only the contract change is
worth keeping: env vars `SYNC_*` → `FLOWBUDDY_*`, bundles `sync-copilot*.js` → `flowbuddy-copilot*.js`,
embed attrs `data-sync-*` → `data-flowbuddy-*`, key header `x-sync-key` → `x-flowbuddy-key`,
`window.SyncCopilot` → `window.FlowBuddy`. **Any pre-rename embed snippet or extension build is inert**
— re-copy the snippet from Studio → Copilot, and install the current store build.

---

## Open items

- **`FLOWBUDDY_EXTENSION_URL`** to be set on **both** `flowbuddy-web` and `flowbuddy-dev-web` (the store listing URL) so the Home checklist CTA reads "Add to Chrome".
- **Presigned uploads have no size ceiling — ⏸ deferred by decision (2026-07-28).** `MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES` and the multipart `fileSize` limit only guard `/v1/sessions`, which artifacts now bypass. Full reasoning + the eventual fix: [`roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md) §9.

> **Standing ordering rule** (learned the hard way, §7.6): a recorder build that a new API *requires* must be **live on the Chrome Web Store before that API reaches prod**. It was overridden once, on 2026-07-28, and only survived because nobody was using the product.
