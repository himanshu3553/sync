/**
 * P4-M1 — the EXECUTION PLAN compiler: turn one approved workflow's distilled steps + its
 * recording's captured events into the replay-ready artifact the acting agent runs, plus the
 * ELIGIBILITY verdict that decides whether the founder may enable acting at all
 * (docs/build/agent.md §A2.2, §A2.9).
 *
 * PURE by design — items and events in, plan and verdict out, no I/O. That is what makes it the
 * first acting code with tests, and what lets the Studio enable action and the worker's reprocess
 * hook share one implementation without this package growing a DB dependency.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **Eligibility is decided HERE, at enable/compile time — never discovered mid-run.** Anything
 *    the executor cannot drive (framed targets, file pickers, foreign-origin hops, steps with no
 *    recoverable anchor) must block the flag while the founder is looking at it, because the
 *    alternative is a safe-stop in front of their customer.
 *  - **The hash pins consent.** `planHash` is content-derived (key-sorted, whitespace-independent),
 *    so "the run executes the exact plan version the user consented to" is checkable equality, not
 *    a timestamp comparison.
 *
 * Tuning constants:
 *   MAX_LOCATORS_PER_STEP = 6 — same cap and same reason as the sense plan: plenty for a resolve
 *     walk, keeps the persisted plan small (`eventLocators` owns the recovery rule itself).
 *   DESTRUCTIVE_LABEL_RE — deliberately over-inclusive. A destructive step costs the end-user ONE
 *     extra confirmation click (§A2.7); a missed one commits something in their live account with
 *     no pause. When in doubt, flag — and submit-type controls are always flagged.
 *   LABEL_MAX = 80 / INSTRUCTION_MAX = 200 / ROUTE_MAX = 512 — wire hygiene, matching the caps the
 *     sense plan already ships under.
