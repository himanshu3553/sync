# FlowBuddy Recorder — Chrome Web Store release log

> **A living doc.** One entry per store build of the recorder extension (`packages/extension`) — what shipped, when it went live, permissions deltas, and the exact baked targets. **Updated every time a new store build is cut**, at packaging time (status flips `packaged → submitted → live` as the release moves). Newest first.
>
> **Naming:** the product was renamed **Sync → FlowBuddy** on 2026-07-17. Builds ≤ 0.4.0 shipped under the old name **"Sync Recorder"** — their entries below keep the names/URLs they actually shipped with. Builds ≥ 0.6.0 ship as **FlowBuddy Recorder** (the listing renamed in place — same item, same extension ID; installed users keep updating).
>
> - **Listing:** <https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sync-recorder/njkfcfpehcklldmeofolnpdljdhcgofk> (this URL goes in `FLOWBUDDY_EXTENSION_URL` on **both** `flowbuddy-web` (prod) and `flowbuddy-dev-web` — **still pending** — powering the Home checklist's "Add to Chrome" CTA; the extension ID `njkf…` is the stable part and survives the listing rename, the name slug in the URL may update).
> - **Build/package mechanics:** [`deploy.md`](deploy.md) §5 (prod-targeted build, multi-origin `STUDIO_URL`, zip rules).

## v0.9.1 — 📦 **PACKAGED 2026-08-25, awaiting submission** — the new-brand-icon build

**Icons only — no code change.** The new FlowBuddy F-mark (from `docs/design_system/assets/FlowBuddyAI_logo.png`, shipped across the product 2026-08-23) replaces the old gradient-square icons in the toolbar, the store listing, and the popup/permission pages. Nothing else differs from v0.9.0.

- **Content:** `icons/icon-{16,32,48,128}.png` regenerated (mark on a white rounded tile); the popup and permission pages render `icons/icon-48.png` where they drew a CSS gradient square.
- **Compatibility:** none — no API, header, or capture change of any kind. No release ordering.
- **Permissions:** **unchanged.**
- **Baked targets:** unchanged — `https://app.flowbuddyai.com` (primary) + `https://flowbuddy-dev-web.onrender.com` + `http://localhost:3000` (bridge only).
- **Artifact:** `packages/extension/flowbuddy-recorder-0.9.1.zip` (gitignored, 119 KB, 24 files) — built `NODE_ENV=production`. Verified before zipping: manifest `0.9.1`, all three bridge origins, `__DEV__` stripped, popup bakes the prod Studio, `X-FlowBuddy-Upload-Id` still sent, new icons in the bundle.
- **Status:** **packaged, awaiting upload to the Web Store.** While in review, v0.9.0 stays live and fully compatible.

## v0.9.0 — ✅ **LIVE on the Chrome Web Store** (submitted 2026-08-12) — the evidence-capture build

**The capture half of execution contracts** ([`execution-contracts.md`](../build/execution-contracts.md) EC-9) — three additive fields that make the evidence layer richer; every consumer fails open on older manifests, so there is no ordering constraint in either direction.

- **Content:**
  - **Checkbox/radio end state:** a change event on a checkbox/radio now carries `checked` (`el.checked` — the real position; `el.value` is literally `"on"` either way, the long-documented gap). The distill timeline can finally say `toggled on`/`toggled off`, and a compiled check step records its `desired` state as **context** — the acting run still asks the user for the value (the values rule is untouched).
  - **`autocomplete` joins the captured-attribute whitelist:** the plan compiler's `cc-*` sensitivity rule always read this attribute, but capture never supplied it — a live dead branch until now. Card-number-shaped fields become point-and-type-always the way the rule intended.
  - **Post-action settle for input commits (DOM only, no post screenshot):** typing then pausing/Enter now captures the field's after-state — inline validation, an enabling submit — which the evidence layer turns into fill-step expectations. A blur caused by clicking the next control supersedes the input's watcher in favor of the click's, the same discard rule consecutive clicks have always had.
- **Compatibility:** none required — all three fields are additive (`checked` on the event, `shot: false` on an internal message, one more captured attribute); the API schema accepts and older manifests keep working everywhere. No release ordering against any API deploy.
- **Permissions:** **unchanged.**
- **Status:** **live.** Submitted 2026-08-12, superseding v0.8.0 while it was still in review — v0.8.0 was withdrawn and **never went live**; its fill-flush content shipped inside this build.

## v0.8.0 — ⚰️ **SUPERSEDED in review, never live** (submitted 2026-08-09) — the fill-flush build

**The full-page-nav capture fix** — a typed value can no longer be lost to the navigation that follows it.

- **Why it exists:** a text field's `change` only fires on commit (blur/Enter), and real apps break that around navigation — a custom submit control that `preventDefault()`s its mousedown never blurs the field, and a programmatic redirect mid-typing commits nothing. The typed value (a whole fill step) silently missed the recording. Harmless-ish for answers; **not** for the acting layer, where a plan compiled without its fill steps submits a half-empty form in a live account — which is what re-prioritised this from capture-quality polish.
- **Content:**
  - **Fill-flush on `submit`:** before emitting the submit event, the form's still-uncaptured field values are emitted as `input` events, so the capture reads fill → fill → submit in the user's actual order.
  - **Fill-flush on `pagehide`:** last chance before a full-page nav — any user-typed value `change` never delivered is committed, the pending post-action watcher settles NOW (`settleReason: "pagehide"`) instead of losing the post-state to the navigation, and the outbox drains while the document can still reach the background.
  - Only fields the **user actually typed in** are swept (tracked via `input` events) — server-prefilled values the user never touched are never captured as the user's steps. A de-dup map guarantees a value `change` already delivered is never emitted twice. Every swept value passes the same `maskValue()` redaction as normal captures.
- **Compatibility:** none required — emits only the existing `input` event shape, no API/header changes, no release-ordering constraint (store-first is satisfied trivially).
- **Permissions:** **unchanged.**
- **Baked targets:** unchanged from v0.7.0 — `https://app.flowbuddyai.com` (primary — the popup's Connect target) + `https://flowbuddy-dev-web.onrender.com` + `http://localhost:3000` (bridge only).
- **Artifact:** `packages/extension/flowbuddy-recorder-0.8.0.zip` (gitignored, 108 KB, 24 files) — built `NODE_ENV=production`. Verified before zipping: manifest `0.8.0`, all three bridge origins, `__DEV__` stripped, popup bakes the prod Studio, `X-FlowBuddy-Upload-Id` still sent, and the sweep's values still pass the sensitive-field mask.
- **Status:** **superseded while in review by v0.9.0 (2026-08-12) and never went live** — this build's fill-flush content shipped inside v0.9.0.

## v0.7.0 — ✅ superseded by v0.9.0 (packaged 2026-07-28) — the build production requires as its FLOOR

**The upload-identity release** — one recording now has one identity, and its artifacts upload while you record instead of in one lump at Stop.

- **Why it exists:** a ~10-minute recording stalled at "Finishing…", the recorder aborted after a flat 120 s, the API committed the recording anyway, and the Retry the user was told to click produced a **second identical recording**. Full analysis in [`copilot.md`](../build/copilot.md) §8·A (R14).
- **Content:**
  - Mints an `uploadId` at Record and sends it as `X-FlowBuddy-Upload-Id`, so a retry resolves to the same recording instead of creating another.
  - Screenshots and DOM snapshots upload **directly to object storage while recording** over short-lived presigned PUT URLs; narration follows the same path at Stop. On a healthy connection the finalize request carries **the manifest and nothing else**. Confirmed artifacts are tracked as `up:<sessionId>:<rel>` markers in IndexedDB.
  - **Removed** (net −85 lines): the hand-rolled `streamingUpload()` ReadableStream, the HTTP/2-only path and its HTTP/1.1 fallback, the 90 %-capped byte progress, the `FINISHING` sentinel, and the dual re-arming watchdogs. **"Finishing… forever" is no longer a reachable state.** The popup shows "Finishing up…", then after 8 s "Sending the rest of your recording…" *with a running timer*.
  - Discards an abandoned recording server-side (`DELETE /v1/uploads/:uploadId`) on "Start fresh" and when a new recording starts over an unsent buffer — so a thrown-away capture no longer strands uploaded artifacts.
  - Degrades to the old all-in-one Stop bundle if signing is unavailable; that path is a deliberate fallback, not leftover.
- **⚠️ COMPATIBILITY — this build is REQUIRED, not optional.** The API returns `400` on `/v1/sessions` without the identity header, and **v0.6.0 does not send it**. The intended ordering is store-first; it was not followed here — the API shipped to production on 2026-07-28 by explicit decision (no customers on prod), which left a window where any installed v0.6.0 could not upload at all. **That window is closed: v0.7.0 is live.** Anyone still on v0.6.0 is fixed by Chrome's own auto-update. Ordering rule for next time: [`deploy.md`](deploy.md) §7.6 — and the lesson is that the window is only survivable when nobody is using the product.
- **Permissions:** **unchanged.** The direct PUTs to object storage are covered by the existing `<all_urls>` host permission — a Chrome MV3 service worker is not subject to CORS for hosts it holds permission for, so **no bucket CORS rule was needed**. Verified end to end against real Cloudflare R2 on dev/Render, 2026-07-28.
- **Baked targets:** `https://app.flowbuddyai.com` (primary — the popup's Connect target) + `https://flowbuddy-dev-web.onrender.com` + `http://localhost:3000` (bridge only).
- **Artifact:** `packages/extension/flowbuddy-recorder-0.7.0.zip` (gitignored) — built `NODE_ENV=production`.
- **Status:** submitted and **live**. No permissions delta, so review took the fast path.

## Superseded versions

One line each. The listing (extension ID `njkfcfpehcklldmeofolnpdljdhcgofk`) is stable across every
version, and `git log -- packages/extension` carries the detail.

| Version | Status | What it was |
|---|---|---|
| **v0.6.0** | ⛔ superseded by v0.7.0 | The production release — first build connecting to `app.flowbuddyai.com`, FlowBuddy "F" icons. **Sends no `X-FlowBuddy-Upload-Id`, so it cannot upload against the current API.** |
| **v0.5.0** | ⚠️ review cancelled 2026-07-17 | The FlowBuddy rename (bridge channels `flowbuddy-ext`/`flowbuddy-page` — a renamed build cannot pair with a pre-rename Studio). Replaced by v0.6.0 to spend one review cycle instead of two. |
| **v0.4.0** | ⚠️ never uploaded | Packaged 2026-07-13 with R13 + logging; obsolete. Do not upload. |
| **v0.3.0** | superseded 2026-07-23 | Was live from 2026-07-13. Its baked Studio URL died with the pre-rename re-deploy. |
| **v0.2.1** | superseded | Approved 2026-07-06. |
| **v0.2.0** | superseded before use | — |
| **v0.1.0** | first upload | Dev build. |

**Permissions have been unchanged since v0.3.0.**

## Cutting a new store release (the checklist)

1. **Bump** `packages/extension/src/manifest.json` `version` (never reuse a submitted number).
2. **Prod build:** `STUDIO_URL="https://app.flowbuddyai.com,https://flowbuddy-dev-web.onrender.com,http://localhost:3000" NODE_ENV=production pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/extension build` (prod Studio FIRST = the popup's primary target; use the real deployed dev URL — Render *may* append a random suffix to a service name) — never zip a stale `dist/` (a default-env build is localhost-only and useless on the store).
3. **Verify the artifact:** `dist/manifest.json` has the new version + bridge `matches` for all three origins; the popup bundle contains `app.flowbuddyai.com`; prod-only expectations hold (minified, `__DEV__` stripped).
4. **Zip:** `cd packages/extension/dist && zip -r ../flowbuddy-recorder-<version>.zip .` (the zip is gitignored).
5. **Check the API contract both ways.** Confirm the artifact sends every header the API requires (today: `X-FlowBuddy-Upload-Id` on `/v1/sessions`), and record in the entry whether this build **must go live before** the matching API reaches prod. Since the upload-identity change, extension and API releases are **ordered, not independent** ([`deploy.md`](deploy.md) §7.6).
6. **Upload** via the Web Store developer dashboard → submit for review. New permissions = slower review; call them out in the entry.
7. **Restore the dev build:** plain `pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/extension build` (local unpacked loads should point at localhost again).
8. **Update the docs:** add the entry HERE (newest first, with commits/permissions/baked targets), plus the store-version notes in [`deploy.md`](deploy.md) §5 and the roadmap P1-M1 row; flip this doc's older entry statuses when a version goes live.

> ⚠️ **The baked Studio URL is part of the artifact.** Moving to a custom domain = rebuild + resubmission (add the new domain to the `STUDIO_URL` list; keep the old one during the transition).
