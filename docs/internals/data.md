# Part 1 — The substrate

## 1. The three stores

| Store | Tech | Holds | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Postgres** | Prisma client ([`schema.prisma`](../../packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma)) | All structured state: tenants, tokens, sources, KB items, approvals, queries, gaps | API, worker, Studio | everyone |
| **Object storage** | S3-compatible — **MinIO** (dev) / **Cloudflare R2** (prod) | Heavy binaries: screenshots, DOM snapshots, audio | **Recorder** (directly, presigned PUT, during recording) + API (leftovers at finalize) | worker (`ArtifactReader`) |
| **Redis** | BullMQ | The `synthesis` job queue (ephemeral) | API (producer) | worker (consumer) |

The split is deliberate: **Postgres for queryable truth, object storage for bulk bytes, Redis for the
async hand-off.** Postgres stores the manifest *JSON* but never the binaries it references.

---

## 2. The Postgres schema (by concern)

Full definitions in [`schema.prisma`](../../packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma). Grouped by what they're
for:

### 2.1 Auth.js (NextAuth) core

`User`, `Account`, `Session`, `VerificationToken` — standard NextAuth tables. `User.passwordHash`
backs the credentials provider; `Account` holds linked Google identities. Used only by [Studio](studio.md).

### 2.2 Tenancy & keys

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Workspace : owns
    Workspace ||--o{ ApiToken : "secret recorder tokens (hashed)"
    Workspace ||--o{ KnowledgeSource : recordings
    Workspace {
        string copilotPublicKey "PUBLIC embed key (pk_…), unique, plaintext"
        string[] copilotAllowedOrigins "origin allowlist (empty = any)"
    }
    ApiToken {
        string hashedToken "SHA-256 of sync_… (plaintext never stored)"
    }
```

- **`Workspace`** is the tenant. It carries the two copilot-embed fields (`copilotPublicKey`,
  `copilotAllowedOrigins`) *and* owns the recorder tokens — i.e. **both API keys hang off the
  workspace**, which is how every credential resolves to a tenant ([connections.md](connections.md) §7).
- **`ApiToken`** stores only the **hash** of the secret recorder token; the public embed key is a
  plaintext column on `Workspace` (it's meant to be visible). The contrast is the whole security model
  in one schema diff.

### 2.3 Capture & Knowledge Base

```mermaid
erDiagram
    KnowledgeSource ||--o{ KnowledgeItem : "distilled steps"
    KnowledgeSource ||--o{ Workflow : "the workflows it currently carries"
    Workflow ||--o| CopilotApproval : "the trust gate — one row = approved"
    KnowledgeSource {
        string uploadId "client-minted recording id, nullable; unique with workspaceId"
        string status "recording→uploaded→processing→ready|error"
        string title "founder rename (null → appBaseUrl)"
        json manifest "the raw capture — NULL until stopped and finalized"
        json transcript "persisted, redacted { text, segments[] }"
    }
    KnowledgeItem {
        string kind "step | topic"
        int orderIndex "order WITHIN the workflow"
        string text "searchable (instruction+detail+narration)"
        json data "DistilledStep payload"
        int segmentIndex "the workflow this belongs to (a denormalized copy, never a key)"
        string segmentTitle "the workflow's goal title"
    }
```

- **`KnowledgeSource`** = one recording. The Prisma model is `KnowledgeSource` but the **table is kept
  as `RecSession`** via `@@map` so historical data survives the rename. `uploadId` is the
  **recorder's own id for the recording**, minted once when Record is pressed and stable across every
  retry; `@@unique([workspaceId, uploadId])` is what makes ingestion idempotent (nullable only so
  pre-existing rows stay valid, and scoped per workspace so a client-supplied value can never collide
  across tenants). `manifest` is the whole raw capture but is **nullable** — null while
  `status='recording'`, filled in when the recording is stopped and finalized;
  `transcript` is added by the worker; `status` is the lifecycle state machine; `title` is the
  founder's optional rename (null falls back to `appBaseUrl`), settable from the Recordings page.
- **`KnowledgeItem`** = one **distilled step**. `data` holds the
  [`DistilledStep`](../../packages/synthesis/src/distill.ts) — defined there, not re-listed here.
  `segmentIndex`/`segmentTitle` group items into workflows. Indexed on `workspaceId` and `sourceId`.

### 2.4 Copilot — gate, analytics, gaps

| Table | What it is |
|---|---|
| **`CopilotApproval`** | The trust gate — one row = one approved workflow, named by a durable **workflow identity**. Two state columns ride it: the retirement column (may it ANSWER?) and the acting flag (may it also RUN?). Why that is a second question rather than a second liveness flag, and who reads it: [knowledge-base.md](knowledge-base.md) §6. |
| **`CopilotQuery`** | Every end-user question — the analytics row and the feedback target. It records not just the outcome but **how the answer was produced** and what the model was looking at. |
| **`CopilotWalkthrough`** (P4-M0) | One row per guided-walkthrough RUN (a session, not a query; optional `queryId` joins the originating question). One behaviour the column list doesn't imply: a run that advances past a stall **recovers** to `active`. |
| **`CoverageGap`** | A question the KB couldn't cover → "record this next". Note `source = "prompt"` is **historical** — it was written by the removed article path, and nothing writes it today. |

### 2.5 Acting — plan, run, acceptance

| Table | What it is |
|---|---|
| **`ExecutionPlan`** | One replay-ready artifact per actable workflow — the founder's recorded steps compiled into something an executor can drive. Its content hash is the **consent pin**. |
| **`ExecutionRun`** | The audit row for one consented run: per-step outcomes and each input's **SOURCE, never the value**. |
| **`AgentAcceptance`** | Who accepted which terms version, and when. |

> Every column, its legal values and the reasoning behind each is in
> [`schema.prisma`](../../packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma), which owns them. What is above is the
> orientation you need to find the right model; the schema is where the argument lives.

### 2.6 Phase-2 articles — REMOVED

The `Article` + `Step` tables (the retired article model) were **dropped** with the
workflows-as-articles decision: the **Version-2 portal track** renders **approved
distilled workflows** as help articles instead of maintaining a parallel article store. The
track's feature list: [`portal.md`](../build/portal.md).

---

## 3. The status state machine

`KnowledgeSource.status` is the single signal every surface uses to know where a recording is:

```
recording ──(stop + manifest)──▶ uploaded ──(worker picks up)──▶ processing ──(KB built)──▶ ready
    │                                │                                │
    └────────────────────────────────┴──────── error ◀────────────────┘   (message in .error)
```

`recording` = artifacts are still arriving. The row is upserted by `(workspaceId, uploadId)` on the
recorder's first signing call, so a capture is visible in Studio while it uploads; `manifest` is null
throughout and the worker skips any job whose row has no manifest yet. `{recording, uploaded, error}`
are the statuses a recording can still be uploaded into — `error` deliberately included, so a failed
build stays retryable.

**`recording` is also the only status a row can be *removed* from behind the founder's back.** Because
the row now exists before anyone commits to the recording, an abandoned capture has to be cleanable:
`DELETE /v1/uploads/:uploadId` deletes it (plus its objects) when the recorder throws a capture away,
and a server-side sweep deletes any `recording` row idle more than **12 hours**. Every later status is
the founder's — a discard against one answers `409` and points at Studio. See
[ingestion-api.md](ingestion-api.md) §4.6.

(`done` is a tolerated legacy value for pre-KB-layer rows.) Defined as `RecSessionStatus` in
[`@flowbuddy/shared/jobs.ts`](../../packages/shared/src/jobs.ts). `ready` means *KB built + segmented,
workflows available to approve* — there are no articles in the copilot-first product.

---

## 4. Object storage layout

One bucket (`flowbuddy-artifacts` by default). Keys are **workspace- and session-prefixed**:

```
workspaces/<workspaceId>/sessions/<sessionId>/<relative-path>
                                              ├── shots/<eventId>.jpg
                                              ├── shots/<eventId>-post.jpg
                                              ├── dom/<eventId>.html
                                              ├── dom/<eventId>-post.html
                                              └── audio.webm
```

- Written **by the [recorder itself](recorder-capture.md)** — screenshots and DOM snapshots during the
  capture, `audio.webm` at Stop — over single-object 900 s presigned PUT URLs the API mints
  (`signPutUrl`). The API writes only what storage never confirmed, at finalize (`putObjectStream` +
  `sessionKey`), and on a healthy connection that is nothing. Either way the relative path is
  **validated against an allowlist** — `shots/<name>.jpg|.jpeg|.png`, `dom/<name>.html`, `audio.webm`
  — before it becomes a key; `sessionKey`'s `..` strip is a backstop, not the control (it is
  defeatable via `....//`).
- **Deleted** by `deleteSessionPrefix(ws, id)` — the whole prefix at once — from three places: Studio
  when the founder deletes a recording, and the API's two cleanup paths for recordings that were never
  finished (§3). Nothing else ever expires: a `ready` recording's artifacts live until it is deleted.
- Read by the [worker](knowledge-base.md) through an **`ArtifactReader`** —
  `sessionArtifactReader(ws, id)` returns a `(relPath) => Promise<Buffer|null>` bound to one session;
  a miss returns `null` (the pipeline tolerates missing artifacts).
- `screenshotFile` on a `DistilledStep` is a **relative path** (e.g. `shots/<id>.jpg`); resolving it to
  a URL/object means re-applying the `workspaces/<ws>/sessions/<id>/` prefix.

The workspace prefix is the storage-level expression of tenancy — one customer's bytes are never under
another's prefix.

---

## 5. Redis / the queue

A single BullMQ queue, name **`synthesis`** (`SYNTHESIS_QUEUE` in
[`@flowbuddy/shared/jobs.ts`](../../packages/shared/src/jobs.ts)). Job body:
`{ sessionId, workspaceId }` — pointers only ([connections.md](connections.md) Seam C). The
[API](ingestion-api.md) is the producer; the [worker](knowledge-base.md) is the consumer
(**`concurrency: 1`** — both run in one process on one small instance, and a synthesis job holds whole
screenshots in memory for the vision calls). The connection is built from `REDIS_URL` (TLS
auto-enabled for `rediss:`) — as **two** objects, because the same process is producer *and* consumer
and they need opposite settings: the consumer's must stay bare so BullMQ can own
`maxRetriesPerRequest: null`, while the producer's adds connect timeouts and capped retries so a sick
Redis fails fast instead of buffering forever. Redis holds **no durable app state** — only
in-flight/queued jobs, and losing them costs a re-process, not a recording.

---

## 6. The three identities, in schema terms

| Identity | Column / table | Stored as | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recorder token (secret) | `ApiToken.hashedToken` | SHA-256 hash | `workspaceId` |
| Embed key (public) | `Workspace.copilotPublicKey` | plaintext, unique | `workspaceId` |
| Studio session | `Session` / `User` (NextAuth) | session token | `User` → owned `Workspace` |

All three converge on a `workspaceId`, which scopes every query. This is the whole tenancy model — see
[connections.md](connections.md) §7.

---

## 7. Migrations (the schema's history)

Prisma migrations live in [`packages/db/prisma/migrations/`](../../packages/db/prisma/migrations) —
**that folder is the history; do not mirror it here.** Names map to module milestones, so `git log`
on the folder reads as a build order.

Commands: `pnpm db:migrate` (apply), `pnpm db:generate` (regen client), `pnpm db:validate`,
`pnpm --filter @flowbuddy/db exec prisma studio` (browse). See [`dev-setup.md`](../ops/dev-setup.md).

# Part 2 — What a real action writes

The moments below are the ones where the write path is non-obvious. The rest are one line each:

| Action | Writes |
|---|---|
| Sign up | A `User` row and a `Workspace` row — the only moment a workspace is created. |
| Verify email / reset password | One token row consumed and deleted. Single-use by construction. |
| Sign in | **Nothing.** A session cookie is minted; no row is written. |
| Connect the recorder | One `ApiToken` row per click. Only the **hash** is stored; the plaintext is shown once and never again. |
| Configure the copilot | `Workspace` columns only — appearance, mode, the ability switches, the embed key and its origin allowlist all live there — with one exception: turning on **AI Agent** mode also writes an `AgentAcceptance` row (who, when, which terms version) in the same transaction, because acting is the contractual line and a toggle state is not a record. |
| Drop the `<script>` on a site | **Nothing**, until someone actually loads the page. |
| The widget loads | One column — a throttled `widgetLastSeenAt`/`Origin` heartbeat. This is what makes "is it embedded?" a real answer rather than a guess from query counts. |
| Thumbs up / down | One column on the existing `CopilotQuery` row. |
| "Walk me through it" | One `CopilotWalkthrough` row per run, updated as the user advances. |

## 5. Recording a workflow → **a row + artifacts start landing while you record**

While the founder records, most of the recording is **already on its way to us** — the recorder pushes
each step's screenshot and page HTML straight to object storage over signed URLs, and the API never
touches those bytes.

| # | Store | What's written, and when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The browser** | Everything is buffered locally as it happens, across three stores — what is in each, and why a crash or a tab close must not lose it: [recorder-capture.md](recorder-capture.md) §5. |
| 2 | **Object storage** | Each artifact as it is captured, PUT by the recorder itself under the session prefix (§4). |
| 3 | **`KnowledgeSource`** | Created by the **first signing call**, not at Stop — `status: "recording"`, `manifest: null`. That is what makes a capture visible in Studio while it is still being made. |

**What is captured per user action** — the event, its timestamp, the target's fingerprint and a
ranked list of ways to find it again, the on-screen box, the route, a screenshot and a page-HTML
snapshot — is the capture contract: [recorder-capture.md](recorder-capture.md) §4.2 and
[`shared/src/capture.ts`](../../packages/shared/src/capture.ts).

**The first privacy line is in the browser, before anything leaves it** — password fields,
sensitive-pattern fields and anything the host app marks `data-flowbuddy-redact` are masked at
capture time ([recorder-capture.md](recorder-capture.md) §4.4).

**If the recording is never finished**, the row and its objects are removed again — by the recorder's
own discard call, or by the server's sweep of idle `recording` rows. Both, and why the sweep
threshold is deliberately generous, are in [ingestion-api.md](ingestion-api.md) §4.6. The write-path
fact that matters here is the one in §3: `recording` is the **only** status a row can be removed
from behind the founder's back.

---

## 6. Stop → finalize → **3 stores written, in this order**

The founder hits stop. The extension flushes the last artifacts (the narration audio included) over
the same signed-URL path, then POSTs to `/v1/sessions` **only what storage has not already
confirmed** — on a healthy connection, the manifest and no files at all. The route itself, its caps,
its fallback multipart path and its idempotency header are in [ingestion-api.md](ingestion-api.md)
§4.2.

**Order matters** — each write only happens if the one before it succeeded:

| # | Store | What's written |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Object storage** | Whatever did **not** already upload directly — normally nothing — streamed under the session prefix (§4). |
| 2 | **`KnowledgeSource`** (the table is still `RecSession`) | The row already exists, so finalize **updates** it: `status: "uploaded"`, `appBaseUrl`, `error: null`, and **`manifest`** — the entire raw capture JSON. |
| 3 | **Redis** | One BullMQ job: `{ sessionId, workspaceId }` — **best-effort**. The recording is already safe in the two stores above, so an unreachable Redis must not turn a delivered recording into a failed upload; the job is recovered from Studio's "Stalled → Re-process" (Part 1 §5). |

**If finalize fails, nothing is deleted** — a deliberate reversal, because the artifacts that already
uploaded live under that prefix and the recorder cannot re-send them. The retry re-uses the same
`uploadId`, overwrites the same keys and updates the same row. Reasoning:
[ingestion-api.md](ingestion-api.md) §4.2.

📌 **The `manifest` column is the biggest single thing we store, and it is permanent.** It holds the
complete raw capture forever — not just what the KB later distills from it. That's deliberate (it is
what makes re-processing possible, and it is the raw material the acting agent's plan compiler reads
at enable time — ranked locators, routes, post-action outcomes, and the before/after DOM snapshots
the appearance markers are diffed from), but it means a recording's full event trail lives in
Postgres indefinitely.

---

## 7. The worker builds the knowledge base → **two tables, written in a fixed order**

The worker picks up the job and runs the pipeline — transcribe → align → clean → segment → distill →
describe. The pipeline itself, and the write mechanics around it (the retry rule, identity matching,
the plan refresh), are [knowledge-base.md](knowledge-base.md) §6's. What belongs here is the shape of
the writes, in order:

| # | When | Table | What's written |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Immediately on pickup | `KnowledgeSource` | `status: "processing"` |
| 2 | After transcription | `KnowledgeSource` | **`transcript`** — the full narration text + timed segments (**PII-scrubbed** first) |
| 3 | After distillation | `KnowledgeItem` | **Delete every existing row for this recording, then insert the fresh ones** |
| 4 | After embedding | `KnowledgeItem.embedding` | A 1536-dimension vector per row, written via raw SQL |
| 5 | Finally | `KnowledgeSource` | `status: "ready"` (+ an `error` string if the build was *degraded* but succeeded) |

**One `KnowledgeItem` row = one step of one workflow:**

| Column | Holds |
|---|---|
| `segmentIndex` / `segmentTitle` | **Which workflow** this step belongs to, and its name |
| `orderIndex` | The step's position *within* that workflow |
| `text` | The searchable blob: instruction + detail + narration, folded into one string |
| `data` | The step itself — the `DistilledStep` shape, defined once in [`distill.ts`](../../packages/synthesis/src/distill.ts). Do not re-list the fields here; this copy had already lost `keyEventId`. |
| `embedding` | The vector for semantic search (nullable — a failed embed just means keyword-only) |

**The second privacy line is here.** Before this text is stored, `redactText` scrubs high-confidence
structured PII — emails, US SSNs, Luhn-valid card numbers, phone numbers — replacing them with typed
placeholders like `[redacted-email]` ([`synthesis/src/redact.ts`](../../packages/synthesis/src/redact.ts)).
Prices, dates, order IDs and version numbers are deliberately left alone.

⚠️ **What is *not* scrubbed:** the screenshots and the DOM HTML in object storage — see §19, which
owns the open gaps.

**Two behaviours worth internalising:**
- **Re-processing is destructive and idempotent.** Step 3 deletes and recreates. Anything attached to
  a *step row* would be lost on every reprocess — which is exactly why approval is **not** stored on
  the step (see next section).
- **A degraded build still lands `ready`.** If transcription or embedding failed, the recording is
  usable and the reason goes in the `error` column as a *notice*, not a failure.

---

## 8. Review and approve in Studio → **1 tiny table, and it's the whole trust model**

The founder browses the built workflows and flips **Approve**. The screen and its actions are
[studio.md](studio.md)'s; what it *writes* is this:

| Action | Table | What changes |
|---|---|---|
| **Approve** / un-approve | `CopilotApproval` | One row per approved workflow — the durable workflow identity, a `segmentTitle` snapshot, who and when, plus the liveness columns and the acting flag. **Absence = not approved: there is no `approved: false`, and un-approving DELETES the row.** |
| Rename a recording | `KnowledgeSource` | `title` (empty clears it) |
| Re-process | `KnowledgeSource` | `status → "uploaded"`, `error → null`, then a new Redis job |
| Delete a recording | Object storage **first**, then `KnowledgeSource` | The row delete **cascades** to its `KnowledgeItem` and `CopilotApproval` rows |
| Let the agent **run** a workflow | `CopilotApproval` + `ExecutionPlan` | The acting flag **and** a freshly compiled plan, in **one transaction**, so "enabled ⇒ a plan exists" holds by construction; disabling deletes the plan row |
| Turn on **AI Agent** mode | `Workspace` + `AgentAcceptance` | The mode flip and the acceptance row in one transaction; rows are never updated, never deleted |

**`CopilotApproval` is the single most important row in the product**, and two things about it are
easy to get wrong from the write side:

- **It names a durable WORKFLOW, not a position and not a step** — which is why it survives §7's
  delete-and-recreate, and why every read path re-checks it server-side rather than trusting
  anything the browser claims. Identity matching, the readers and the liveness rule:
  [knowledge-base.md](knowledge-base.md) §6.
- **The stored `segmentTitle` is the DISPLAY TRUTH.** When the widget sends a workflow title over the
  wire, the server ignores it and uses this snapshot instead — the title a founder sees in an audit
  row is never one a page supplied.

---

## 12. An end-user asks a question → **the busiest moment in the system**

`POST /v1/copilot/answer` ([`api/src/server.ts:546`](../../packages/api/src/server.ts#L546)).

**What the widget *sends* us (and what happens to it):**

| Sent | Stored? |
|---|---|
| The question text | ✅ **Yes** — `CopilotQuery.question` |
| The page path (e.g. `/settings`) | ✅ Yes — `CopilotQuery.contextPath`, capped at 512 chars |
| Where it thinks the user is (workflow + step guesses) | ⚠️ **Partly** — the *outcome* is stored, the raw guesses are not |
| The previous answer's cited workflows | ❌ No — used to bias retrieval, then discarded |
| The chat history | ❌ **No** — used in the prompt, never persisted server-side |
| Page state for diagnosis (masked field structure) | ❌ **No** — only a *flag* saying diagnosis ran |
| A rendered image of the page | ❌ **No** — only a `true`/`false` that one rode along |

**What gets written, in order:**

| # | Table | When | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Workspace` | Every answer | The `widgetLastSeenAt` heartbeat (same 5-min throttle) |
| 2 | **`CopilotQuery`** | Always (one row per question) | See the breakdown below |
| 3 | **`QueryCitation`** | Only on a grounded answer | **One row per cited workflow** — `sourceId`, `segmentIndex`, `segmentTitle` snapshot. Created in the same call, nested under the query. |
| 4 | **`CoverageGap`** | Only on a decline the ENGINE made (see behaviour 4) | `prompt` = the question, `reason` = why it declined, `source: "copilot"`, `status: "open"` — **deduped**: if an open gap with the identical question exists, no new row |

**Inside one `CopilotQuery` row:**

| Column | Holds |
|---|---|
| `question` | The end-user's question, **PII-scrubbed before it is written** (§19) |
| `answered` | `true` = grounded answer given, `false` = declined |
| `contextPath` | The page they were on |
| `feedback` | `null` for now — filled in later, if the end-user thumbs the answer |
| `senseSourceId` / `senseSegmentIndex` / `senseStep` / `senseConfidence` | **Where we located the user** — workflow, step number, confidence |
| `senseUsed` | `used` (the answer was about that position) \| `ignored` (we located them, answered about something else) \| `none` (we looked, found nothing) \| `null` (never looked) |
| `reasonTrigger` | Why diagnosis fired: `intent` (they used diagnostic words) \| `blocked` (the step's button was disabled) \| `escalation` (the fast path declined, the widget retried with evidence) |
| `reasonImage` | Whether a page image rode along |
| `mode` | The workspace's setting when they asked — `copilot` \| `agent` (`chatbot` on rows predating its 2026-08-02 retirement) |
| `engine` | **Which engine actually answered** — `agent` \| `reason` \| `floor`. Not always what `mode` predicts, and `floor` matches no mode at all: it is the fallback, so a run of them is a reliability signal |
| `inputTokens` · `cachedInputTokens` | What the question's prompts cost. The cached figure is a SUBSET of the first, billed at a fraction — ignoring it overstates spend badly, because these prompts are long and stable |
| `outputTokens` · `reasoningTokens` | What the model produced. Reasoning is a SUBSET of output (it bills as output on a reasoning model) and explains both expensive answers and the `max_output_tokens` failure mode |
| `rounds` | Model calls made (1 = answered straight from retrieval) |
| `toolCalls` | Tool invocations the model asked for, including ones the loop refused |

**Four behaviours that trip people up:**

1. **The Studio preview writes nothing.** A founder testing their own copilot sends `preview: true` —
   same engine, same answer, but **zero** analytics writes and no `queryId` (so no thumbs).
2. **An escalation writes nothing on the first pass — and only a SINGLE-CALL answer escalates now.** When the fast path declines and the widget is
   about to retry with page evidence, we return `escalate: true` and log *nothing* — the retry logs
   the real outcome, so one question never becomes two rows or a phantom coverage gap.
3. **"No approved content at all" is logged as a decline but not as a gap.** An un-provisioned copilot
   isn't a knowledge gap, so `CopilotQuery` gets a row and `CoverageGap` doesn't.
4. **OUR OWN failures are logged as declines but not as gaps.** A truncated answer (the output budget
   spent on reasoning) and a body-level provider failure both come back as empty text that reads as an
   ordinary decline. A gap is a claim about the KB — *"someone asked this and you never recorded it"* —
   and a founder cannot fix either of these by recording anything, so filing them poisons the one feed
   that decides what to record next. Suppression keys on the **final** engine's stats, so an agent
   failure the floor rescued still files its decline as the real gap it is. The end-user still gets the
   decline and `CopilotQuery` still gets its row; only the accusation against the KB is withheld.
   **These are countable in the logs, not in the database** — a `coverage gap suppressed` warning
   carries the reason, and no column records it.

**In the end-user's browser**, meanwhile: the conversation is written to `sessionStorage` so it
survives a full-page navigation — **max 20 messages, 30-minute TTL, tab-scoped, gone when the tab
closes** ([`widget/src/session.ts`](../../packages/widget/src/session.ts)). An **allowlist of message
kinds** decides what may be persisted: run narration IS stored (the narrative has to survive the page
loads the run itself causes), while a value supplied in the chat rides a kind that was never added to
the list and is therefore never written, by construction.

---

## 14. An end-user consents to a run → **one audit row, and never a value**

Clicking **Run it** on the consent sheet is the write. The server re-verifies the workspace's mode,
the workflow's liveness, the acting flag and the plan hash *before* the row exists at all — the
refusal shapes are in [copilot.md](copilot.md) §3.

| # | Table | When | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`ExecutionRun`** | At the consent click | The consent moment and the **pinned plan hash** — the version of the steps the user actually agreed to |
| 2 | `ExecutionRun` | As the run proceeds | Per-step outcomes, and each input's **SOURCE** (`prefill` \| `typed` \| `chat`) |
| 3 | `ExecutionRun` | At the end | A terminal outcome — `completed` \| `aborted` \| `safe_stop` — with its reason and the step it stopped on |

**The values themselves ride the page, never the wire.** A value the user gave in the chat is typed
into their own form and is gone; a sensitive one is never typed by us at all. The audit answers
*what did it do* and *where did each value come from* without ever answering *what was it*.

## 15. The founder reads Analytics → **nothing written, and this is the payoff**

Everything in step 12 exists **for this moment**. Storing the questions isn't bookkeeping — *"what are
my users actually stuck on?"* is one of the things the founder is buying. Analytics is entirely reads
over `CopilotQuery`, `QueryCitation`, `CoverageGap`, `CopilotWalkthrough` and `ExecutionRun`. The one write:
dismissing a gap sets `CoverageGap.status = "resolved"` (the row is kept, never deleted).

**What the founder actually sees, and which stored data it comes from:**

| Where in Studio | What it shows | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| **Home** | The **last 5 questions**, verbatim, answered or not | `CopilotQuery` |
| **Copilot** tab | The **last 8 questions**, verbatim | `CopilotQuery` |
| **Analytics → Questions** (`/dashboard/analytics/questions`) | **The full log** — every question ever asked, newest first: search (question text *or* page path), filter (all / answered / declined / 👍 / 👎), range incl. **all time**, 25 per page. Each row shows the question, answered-or-declined, the workflows it cited, the page, the thumbs, and when. | `CopilotQuery` + `QueryCitation` |
| **Analytics** → *Questions & answer rate* | Answered vs declined per day over 7/30/90 days | `CopilotQuery.answered` + `createdAt` |
| **Analytics** → *Resolved without a human* | "≈ N questions your team didn't have to touch" | `CopilotQuery.answered` |
| **Analytics** → **Coverage gaps — record this next** | Unanswered questions **ranked by how often they were asked** ("asked 14×"), with the copilot's reason for declining, and a dismiss button | `CoverageGap` joined to a count of matching declined `CopilotQuery` rows |
| **Analytics** → *Recent declines* | The last 5 questions we couldn't answer **+ the page they were asked on** | `CopilotQuery` where `answered = false` |
| **Analytics** → **Where users get stuck** | Ranked *(workflow, step)* pairs — the exact step people ask for help at, with that step's instruction | `CopilotQuery.senseSourceId/senseSegmentIndex/senseStep` where `senseUsed = 'used'` |
| **Analytics** → *Top workflows by citations* | Which approved recordings are carrying the answers | `QueryCitation` grouped by workflow |
| **Analytics** → **Agent runs** | Recent runs with their outcomes; safe-stops called out as an alarm rather than a row in a distribution — a safe-stop is the agent refusing to guess in front of a customer, which is the signal a founder must not have to look for | the run audit rows |
| **KB** → a workflow's detail page | That workflow's all-time cited count, last-cited date, and 👍/👎 tally | `QueryCitation` + the parent query's `feedback` |

**The two "record this next" signals are the product's feedback loop**, and they're different questions:

- **Coverage gaps** = *"you have no content for this at all"* → go record it.
- **Where users get stuck** = *"you have content, and people still need help at step 4"* → that step
  is unclear, or the product is.

**Still not surfaced:** there's no CSV/API export — the log is a reading surface only. Deliberate for
now; the in-UI search was the actual need.

**Fixed 2026-07-27 — `QueryCitation` used to count one row per cited STEP, not per workflow.** The
answer engine dedupes citations by `KnowledgeItem` id (right for grounding — an answer built from
six steps legitimately cites six items), and that list was persisted one-to-one, so **six rows all
named the same workflow**. Every reader counted rows, so *"Top workflows by citations"* ranked
workflows by **how many steps they have rather than how often they were used**, and one 👍 on a
six-step answer added **six** to that workflow's helpful score. The end-user never saw it — the
widget dedupes citation titles before rendering the "Source" pill, which is why it survived.

The fix has two halves, because a writer fix alone would leave every existing row wrong:
- **Writer** (`api` `citationRows`) collapses to one row per `(sourceId, segmentIndex)`, so the
  stored shape finally matches this table's own schema comment.
- **Readers** (`web/lib/analytics.ts`) count **distinct `queryId`**, not rows — which is the metric
  the cards actually mean ("how many questions did this workflow answer?") and is correct for the
  old duplicated rows and the new clean ones alike. **No backfill, nothing deleted.** On the dev
  workspace this took the count from an inflated **43 → 11**, matching the real question count.

> **If you add a reader of `QueryCitation`: count distinct questions, not rows.**

## 18. What we deliberately **don't** store

Worth knowing as clearly as what we do:

| Not stored | Where it exists instead |
|---|---|
| Plaintext passwords | Only bcrypt hashes |
| Plaintext recorder tokens | Only SHA-256 hashes; the real one lives in the founder's extension |
| Plaintext email verify/reset tokens | Only SHA-256 hashes; the real one lives in the email |
| Login sessions | A signed JWT cookie in the browser |
| The end-user's chat history | Their own tab's `sessionStorage`, 30 min, then gone |
| The diagnostic page-state capture | Sent at ask time, used in the prompt, dropped — only a trigger label survives |
| The rendered page image | Same — only a `true`/`false` survives |
| Sensitive typed values from recordings | Masked to `••••••` in the founder's browser before upload |
| The values an acting run types into a form | The end-user's own page. The audit records only each input's **SOURCE**, never the value — and a value supplied in the chat rides a message kind that is never persisted, never sent to the answer endpoint, and never logged |
| Sensitive values during a run (passwords, card fields, cross-origin frames) | Typed by the user straight into the app's own field. They never enter FlowBuddy at all — not the chat, not the wire, not the database |
| Rate-limit counters, heartbeat throttles, sense-plan cache | In memory in the API process; reset on restart |

## 19. Known gaps in what we store

1. **Screenshots and DOM snapshots in object storage are unredacted.** The masking ladder covers typed
   values and text, not pixels or raw HTML. A recording made against real customer data stores that
   data as-is. *(This is the live one.)*

Two former gaps are closed, each leaving a residual worth knowing:

- **`CopilotQuery.question` scrubbing** — storage only, so retrieval and the model still
  see the raw question and answer quality is unchanged. Rows written earlier were **not** back-filled.
  **Residual:** the phone pattern needs a 3-digit area group, so international formats like
  `+91 98765-43210` are *not* caught — deliberate (false-negatives over false-positives), but real.
- **Answer provenance and cost** — `mode`, `engine`, `rounds`, `toolCalls` and (since 2026-08-03)
  `inputTokens` / `cachedInputTokens` / `outputTokens` / `reasoningTokens` are recorded per question.
  `engine` and `mode` are stored separately because they disagree in both directions. All are `null`
  on earlier rows, so an un-instrumented question reads "unknown" rather than "free". Spend is the
  TOTAL for the question, summed across every loop it ran — a question the agent failed and the
  floor caught paid for both. Studio reads them on Analytics → *How answers were produced*.
